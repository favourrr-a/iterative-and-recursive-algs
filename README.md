# Iterative and Recursive Algorithms
## Implemented Algorithms
- Maximum Element
- Unique Element
- Matrix Multiplication
- Gaussian Elimination
- Counting Binary Digits
- Factorial
- Fibonacci Numbers
- Tower of Hanoi

## Project Structure
All algorithms exist in separate classes and the algorithms themselves are static methods in the classes

The main method uses the algorithm methods from their respective classes

## Upcoming features
Users will have the ability to choose which algorithm they want to use, and then input values with respect to the algorithm chosen
